SQL Injection Detection: Solutions and Challenges of Traditional Machine Learning Models
SQL injection(SQLi) is a significant danger to web
applications which compromises their security and
integrity. Despite improvements in security
technologies,these attacks continue to exploit
vulnerabilities in application code, allowing harmful
actors to manipulate database queries and potentially
steal sensitive information.
Measures of traditional security often rely on static
analysis, signature-based detection, and WAFs. While
these techniques can be powerful in reducing known
attacks, they may struggle to identify novel and
evolving SQL injection techniques. In addition , these
methods often require some important manual effort
and expertise to maintain and update.
